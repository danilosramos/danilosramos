# Hello! I'm Danilo Silveira Ramos 👋

### Computer Engineering Student | Specialist in Embedded Systems and Data Structures

Welcome to my portfolio of academic and personal projects. I am a student passionate about **solving complex problems**, with a focus on **low-level programming**, **embedded systems**, and **high-performance algorithms**.

My experience ranges from digital hardware design with VHDL to the implementation of complex data structures in C++ and the development of desktop applications with a graphical interface.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

| Category | Technologies and Concepts |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Languages** | **C** (Advanced), **C++** (OOP, Templates), VHDL, Assembly (Microcontrollers) |
| **Data Structures** | AVL Trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists |
| **Embedded Systems** | Microcontroller Programming (PIC/AVR), Control Logic, Simulation (Proteus) |
| **Development** | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Qt Framework (GUI), Git/GitHub |

## 🌟 Featured Projects

These projects demonstrate my ability to apply theory to practical and robust solutions.
